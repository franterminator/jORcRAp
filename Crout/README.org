* Crouting is simple
** WTF? Is that folder
- In this folder I have a programs in differents languages
  for solving a crout decomposition.
** What is a Crout Decomposition?
- It is the way of separate a matrix in other three matrix: L , D and U.
- So the a matrix called A = L * D * U
*** L matrix
- It is a subdiagonal matrix. Like the below one.
 |  1 |  0 |  0 | 0 |
 | 12 |  1 |  0 | 0 |
 | 25 | 41 |  1 | 0 |
 | 63 | 25 | 14 | 1 |
*** D matrix
- It is a diagonal matrix. Like the below one.
| 25 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
|  0 | 85 |  0 |  0 |
|  0 |  0 | 41 |  0 |
|  0 |  0 |  0 | 14 |
*** U matrix
- It is a upperdiagonal matrix. Like the below one.
| 1 | 25 | 85 | 96 |
| 0 |  1 | 47 | 58 |
| 0 |  0 |  1 | 36 |
| 0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |
** Which is the algorithm
[[./img/algorithm.jpg]]
- The do ->/code/-> enddo are loops in fortran.
- *BECAREFUL THE START AND END OF LOOP ARE INCLUDE IN THE COUNT OF THE LOOP*
  It is not like C. It is the mathematical algorithm.
** Why I want to use it
- It makes easier solving matrix system.
** When I can use it
- You can use it always in Positive-definite matrix.
- In other cases depends.
