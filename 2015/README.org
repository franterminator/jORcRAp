* INSTALATION
1. Try to use the "run.bat". If doesn't work you have to go to 2.
2. Try to use the "compile.bat" then try to use the "run.bat".
   If doesn't work you have to compile manually.
** Requirements
- For running the "run.bat" files you need java installed in your system.
  Also you need a Windows system.
- For running the "compile.bat" you need the GCC compiler. If you another C
  compiler you have to compile manually.
* Code and compilation
- The code are strucuture in this way:
  1. The java code is just a swing frame which executes the C code.
  2. The C code has to be compile first and has the calculation code.
  3. The C compiledprogram has to be in a Folder called C, and its must be rio.exe.
     That will be in the directory where you call the jar program.
     Look at my run.bat. If you use it, the directory is where the run.bat is.
     So the C folder (with the rio.exe) has to be near run.bat.
